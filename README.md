# Connect 4 Game

This project is a web-based implementation of the classic game Connect 4.

## Instructions

- The game is played on a grid of 6 rows and 7 columns.
- Two players take turns dropping their colored discs into any of the columns.
- The goal is to connect four of your own discs in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
- The first player to achieve this wins the game.

## Technologies Used

- HTML - Structure and layout of the game.
- CSS - Styling and visual appearance of the game.
- JavaScript - Game logic and interactivity.

## Usage
