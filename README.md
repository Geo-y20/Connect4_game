    <li>The game is played on a grid of 6 rows and 7 columns.</li>
    <li>Two players take turns dropping their colored discs into any of the columns.</li>
    <li>The goal is to connect four of your own discs in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.</li>
    <li>The first player to achieve this wins the game.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
